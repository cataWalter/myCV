\datedexperience{Amadeus}{2023 - Present}
\explanation{Backend Developer}{Nice, France}
\explanationdetail{
    \smallskip
    I was part of the team that developed RESTful APIs for a distributed, cloud-native data management system running on Azure. I used Quarkus and Java, always keeping performance, security, and scalability in mind. For data persistence, I worked hands-on with NoSQL databases â€“ specifically Couchbase. I also integrated our system with Kafka to enable event-driven communication. I handled deploying and managing our applications on Kubernetes. I used Helm charts and Argo CD, following GitOps principles to keep things consistent. We used Istio service mesh, and I got really involved with its traffic management features, mTLS encryption, and the observability tools (like distributed tracing and metrics). In addition to my development work, I also took on the role of Scrum Master within our SAFe framework, helping the team stay organized and productive.
